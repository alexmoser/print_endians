# Print Endians
Small program that accepts an unsigned 32-bit number from the user and then displays that number in big-endian and little-endian byte formats.

Example input: 
```
32000000
```

Example output: 
```
Big Endian: 01 E8 48 00
Little Endian: 00 48 E8 10
```
## Information
The program accepts any inputs but it returns error if:
- More than one input parameter is provided
- The input provided is not a positive integer number
- The input provided is not representable on 32bits (is â‰¥ 2^32)
- The input contains characters other than digits

Notes:
- Leading whitespaces are ignored
- A leading `+` symbol is accepted

## Usage
Call the compiled program and pass the number as parameter. 

### Example
From terminal:
```sh
./print_endian 12003400
```

Will produce the following output:
```sh
Input: 12003400
Little Endian:  48 28 B7 00 
Big Endian:     00 B7 28 48 
```
